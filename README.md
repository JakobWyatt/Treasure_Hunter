# Treasure_Hunter
My submission to the 2019s1 UCP Curtin University assignment.
All functionality has been implemented, and no bugs have been found.

Source code is inside src/.
Run
```
make clean && make
```
to build this project.

To generate documentation, run doxygen in the top level folder of this project.
Documentation should appear under docs/latex, after running docs/latex/Makefile.

All test cases and test scripts are in test/.
To run these, change directory inside src/ and run
```
bash ../test/all_tests.sh.
```

A report, containing design information, is located at report.pdf/report.tex.
The pdf file was generated using lualatex.
